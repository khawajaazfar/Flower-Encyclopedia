        <h2>About the Tulip</h2>
        <p>Tulips are a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes. The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, combined).</p>
        
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>Tulips are extremely popular garden flowers and are also used as cut flowers. They were famously part of the first recorded speculative bubble, known as "Tulip Mania" in the Netherlands during the 17th century.</p>
