        <h2>About the Sunflower</h2>
        <p>The sunflower (<strong>Helianthus annuus</strong>) is a living organism in the family Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide. Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head.</p>
        
        <h2>Heliotropism</h2>
        <p>A common misconception is that sunflowers track the Sun across the sky. Mature sunflowers typically face east. However, the flower buds and young leaves do exhibit heliotropism (sun-tracking).</p>
